# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier - encide-ml
This repository contains code and resources for training and evaluating image classification models to distinguish between cats and dogs using TensorFlow/Keras.  
This project is part of the **encide-ml competition**.

## Project Overview

- Implements two distinct models:
  - **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**  
    Constructed from scratch using multiple Conv2D layers, each followed by BatchNormalization and Dropout for regularization. The architecture uses MaxPooling for spatial reduction and concludes with a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer before dense layers for classification. Data augmentation and normalization are applied at the input pipeline to enhance generalization.
  - **Transfer Learning with ResNet-50:**  
    Utilizes a pretrained ResNet-50 model (`include_top=False`) as a feature extractor. Custom dense layers are added on top for binary classification. The base model is initially frozen during training, then partially unfrozen for fine-tuning. Preprocessing includes normalization and ResNet-50-specific input scaling. Data augmentation is also applied.
- Training incorporates early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing to ensure optimal performance and prevent overfitting.
- Both models are saved in Keras (`.keras`) and TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`) formats for deployment or further use.




## ðŸ“Š Training Summary

- **Dataset:** ~20 000 images (train), 4 000 for validation, 5 000 test  
- **Base model:** ResNet50 (ImageNet weights) frozen for 15 epochs, then top ~200 layers fine-tuned for 10 epochs  
- **Best validation accuracy:** 77.0 % (Epoch 7)  
- **Final validation metrics:**  
  - Accuracy: 76.4 %  
  - AUC: 0.8508  
  - Precision: 0.7225  
  - Recall: 0.8692

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Images are loaded from directory structure using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`.
   - Data augmentation includes random flips, rotations, zoom, contrast, and translation.
   - Normalization is applied to all images.

2. **Model Architectures**
   - Custom CNN: Multiple convolutional blocks with BatchNormalization and Dropout.
   - ResNet-50: Pretrained on ImageNet, with custom dense layers added. The base model is initially frozen, then partially unfrozen for fine-tuning.

3. **Training**
   - EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint are used to prevent overfitting and save the best model.
   - Learning rate scheduling is used for the custom CNN; a fixed low learning rate is used for fine-tuning ResNet-50.

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Training and validation metrics (accuracy, loss, AUC, precision, recall) are reported.
   - Training history is visualized and saved as `training_history.png`.

5. **Model Export**
   - Models are saved in Keras (`.keras`) and TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`) formats for deployment or further use.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/haroon0x/encide-ml-haroon.git
    cd encide-ml-haroon
    ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv:**
    
    ```
    pip install uv
    ```

    ```
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    _or, if using uvâ€™s project workflow:_
    ```
    uv venv
    uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
    ```

3. **Prepare the dataset** 
   # ðŸ“¥ Download Kaggle Data
   
   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download salader/dogs-vs-cats
   unzip dogs-vs-cats.zip -d data/

4. **Run the desired notebook or script** to train and evaluate a model.
    ## ðŸ”Ž Model Inferencing

    - To use a trained model for predicting a single image:

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
    import numpy as np

    # Load model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model("best_dog_cat_model_resnet.keras")  # or dog_cat_model_s.keras
   
    # Load and preprocess image
    img_path = "path_to_image.jpg"
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

    # Predict
    pred = model.predict(img_array)
    label = "Dog" if pred[0][0] > 0.5 else "Cat"
    print(f"Prediction: {label} ({pred[0][0]:.2f})")

    ```
    - For TFLite inference, use tf.lite.Interpreter instead.
